    "Delivering swift and reliable news since the 1830s and 1840s, news agencies have played a pivotal role both nationally and internationally. However, understanding their precise impact on shaping news content has remained somewhat elusive. Our goal is to illuminate this aspect by identifying news agencies within historical newspaper articles. Using data from newspapers in Switzerland and Luxembourg as part of the Impresso project, we've trained our pipeline to recognize these entities.\n",
