    "This notebook is similar to the [NE-processing_ImpressoHF](https://github.com/impresso/impresso-datalab-notebooks/blob/main/annotate/NE-processing_ImpressoHF.ipynb) one, except that instead of loading the model from Hugging Face and executing them locally (or on Colab), here we use the annotation functionalities provided by the Impresso API, using the Impresso Python Library. Behind the scene the same models are used. \n",

    "For more information on the models, please refer to the [NE-processing_ImpressoHF](https://github.com/impresso/impresso-datalab-notebooks/blob/main/annotate/NE-processing_ImpressoHF.ipynb) notebook (we advised starting with it).\n",
