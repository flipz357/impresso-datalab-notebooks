However, understanding their precise impact on shaping news content has remained somewhat elusive. Our goal is to illuminate this aspect by identifying news agencies within historical newspaper articles. Using data from newspapers in Switzerland and Luxembourg as part of the impresso project, we've trained our pipeline to recognize these entities. \n","\n","If you're here, you likely seek to detect news agency entities in your own text.
